# ---------- Everything this script and the daemon print goes to a file as well as stdout ----
# The daemon is exec'd at the end of this script, so its stdout IS this script's stdout: the
# container log stream, and nowhere else. That is fine for a console and useless for anything
# automated — you cannot tail it over ssh, grep it, or diff two runs, because inside the
# container there is no file to read.
#
# That gap cost a whole test run. A pod was working through a job while every check for its
# progress came back empty, because they were reading a daemon.log that only exists when the
# daemon is started by hand. The pod looked idle and was reported as idle.
#
# Process substitution rather than a pipeline, so the final `exec python3 -m daemon.main` still
# replaces this shell and stays the container's main process — a pipeline would leave the shell
# alive as PID 1 and change how SIGTERM reaches the daemon on stop.
mkdir -p /workspace/logs
# Timestamp every line. Without it there is no way to tell a boot that is slow from one that is
# wedged: both look like a log that has stopped moving.
#
# A bash read loop rather than awk, because `awk` here is MAWK. mawk reads its input in blocks
# and only processes a block once it is full or the pipe closes -- and `fflush()` flushes its
# OUTPUT, which is not the side that is holding anything. During a 45-minute silent model
# download the boot produces a few hundred bytes, so nothing ever reached the log at all: on
# two real pods daemon.log sat at 0 bytes and the RunPod console showed nothing after the
# NVIDIA banner while the boot ran normally the whole time. Exactly the wedge/slow ambiguity
# this timestamping exists to remove, caused by the timestamping.
#
# It read as correct because a development box runs GAWK, which does not buffer this way, and
# because a test that lets the script EXIT flushes on close and passes. Reproduced in
# ubuntu:22.04 with the script still running: mawk 0 bytes, this loop 120 bytes.
#
# `read` on a pipe returns per line, so there is no buffering stage left to get this wrong.

# and LoRA strengths, and keeping them at parity with the 3090's .env was a standing hazard —
# a different default produces plausible output that is not comparable to anything, and that
# cost a full day once. Under LTX those values live in the recipe, which wanly-api resolves and
# ships inside the claim. There is nothing here to drift.
