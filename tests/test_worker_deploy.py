"""The long-lived worker must converge on :latest, and never mid-render (#72).

The 3090 ran a 37-hour-old image and a 14-hour-old daemon while a RunPod pod ran current
code, and the two produced different results from the same queue. Nothing detected it; it
surfaced as a 422 that looked random.

These tests guard the two halves of the fix: that the container spec is complete enough to
recreate the worker correctly, and that the updater's decision logic is right -- because
every wrong decision it can make is expensive. Recreating mid-render loses 10-13 minutes and
leaves a segment to be reclaimed; never recreating leaves the drift in place.
