"""Purging a finished render's local media (console#380).

out.mp4 and the keyframe pngs are ~2.7 GB across 500 jobs and grow by ~5 MB per render,
forever. They are duplicates by the time this runs — the daemon uploads to S3 first.

graph.json and prompt.txt are NOT duplicates. Together they are ~7 MB across those same 500
jobs and are the only local record of what a render actually did: which LoRAs at which
strengths, against which checkpoint, from which prompt. Deleting them to reclaim 0.3% of the
space would be a bad trade, and these tests are what stops a future "purge everything"
simplification.
