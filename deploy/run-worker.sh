# Create (or recreate) the long-lived worker container on a box we own — today the 3090.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS AS A FILE
#     A RunPod pod is created from :latest every time, so it is always current on both update
#     channels: the image, and the daemon that start.sh clones from main at boot. A long-lived
#     container is only current on the second one -- `docker restart` reuses the image by
#     design. The 3090 therefore drifted to a 37-hour-old image and a 14-hour-old daemon while
#     a pod ran tonight's code, and the two produced different results from the same queue
#     (wanly-gpu-docker#72).
#
#     Nobody recreated it because the `docker run` existed only in one shell's history.
#     Reproducing it from memory is exactly the kind of thing that gets a mount or a port
#     wrong, so it lives here instead.
#
# SAFE TO RE-RUN. It stops and removes the existing container first, so this is also the
# rollback path: point IMAGE at an older tag and run it again.
