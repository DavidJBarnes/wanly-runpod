# Converge a long-lived worker on :latest, but never mid-render (wanly-gpu-docker#72).
#
# Run from a timer. Does nothing at all unless the published image has actually changed, so
# it is cheap to run often.
#
# WHY IDLE MATTERS MORE THAN FRESHNESS
#     A render is 10-13 minutes (measured: 613s and 759s on the 3090). Recreating the
#     container mid-render throws that work away, and the segment is then reclaimed by the
#     stale-heartbeat path -- so an eager updater costs more than the drift it fixes. This
#     checks the worker is not processing and, if it is, exits and leaves the next run to it.
#
# WHY IT COMPARES DIGESTS, NOT TAGS
#     :latest is a moving pointer. "Am I on latest?" is only answerable by comparing the
#     digest the container was created from against the digest the tag resolves to NOW.

# TWO independent signals, and BOTH must say idle. Each covers the other's blind spot.
#
#   1. THE WORKER'S OWN STATUS, from the API. The daemon sets online-busy the instant it
#      receives a claim, BEFORE [1/6], and online-idle only once the segment finishes. That
#      is the only signal covering the WHOLE claim.
#
#      This is the check that was missing, and its absence cost a segment. The first version
#      asked only the engine -- which knows nothing until [3/6] Submitting. A container was
#      recreated 50% through a 673 MB LoRA download in [2/6]; the engine truthfully said
#      running=0, the segment was abandoned mid-claim, and because registration reuses the
#      worker row it was pinned to a live busy worker where no reclaim rule could reach it.
#      It sat in PROCESSING for seven hours.
#
#      The gap widened the same day: console#423 lets a worker fetch a 46 GB checkpoint on
#      demand, which is ~20 minutes inside [2/6] with the engine reporting idle throughout.
#
#   2. THE ENGINE. Kept, because the daemon's status push can fail -- the API's own reclaim
#      logic says so. If the daemon claims idle while the engine is rendering, believe the
#      engine.
#
# Asked with `docker exec`, NOT through the published port: the engine binds 127.0.0.1 INSIDE
# the container, so -p 8190:8190 resolves to nothing and a host curl returns empty -- which
# parsed naively reads as "idle".
