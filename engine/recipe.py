"""Recipe resolution: a resolved (character, pose) configuration -> a ComfyUI graph.

NOTHING IS LOOKED UP HERE. Every value arrives in the request.

This module used to read recipes/recipes.json, generated from an ODS sheet, and resolve a
recipe BY NAME. That was the last of the spreadsheet, and it outlived the migration that made
recipes database rows (wanly-api#212): the API and console became DB-native while the engine
kept its own eight-name file, so a pose authored in the console rendered as

    KeyError: "unknown recipe 'Doggystyle Side v2'"

and — worse and quieter — editing a SEEDED pose changed nothing, because the engine read its
own frozen copy of the prompt instead of the one the user saved.

The rule this restores is wanly-api#207: an engine that cannot look a recipe up cannot look up
a STALE one. The daemon already sends the resolved configuration verbatim ("it is read, never
looked up"), so the file was supplying defaults for fields the caller always provides.

What is NOT decided here any more: whether a render is "as validated". That was a comparison
against the sheet's baseline. Validation is a property of the pose row now, which the API and
console own.
