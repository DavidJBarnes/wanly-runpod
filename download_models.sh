# Model staging for the LTX 2.3 worker.
#
# On the 3090 the LTX-2.3 set is BIND-MOUNTED read-only from the host
# (/home/david/LTX-2/models -> /workspace/models), so there is nothing to fetch and this
# script only has to prove the mount is really there and really complete.
#
# On a fresh pod with no such mount there IS a fetch to do, and it is written below.
#
# WHAT a pod needs comes from the workflow, not from what happens to sit in the folder on the
# 3090. That box holds 217 GB because it accumulated alternates -- three 43 GB checkpoints the
# recipe never names. The workflow template names four files, and the recipe patches in two
# more, so a working pod needs ~108 GB and not the folder.
#
# Progress reporting follows what #39 established for the WAN downloader this replaced:
# announce each file BEFORE starting it, and report size, elapsed and MB/s on completion.
# hf downloads print nothing while a 43 GB weight comes down, so reporting only on success
# means many minutes of silence that are indistinguishable from a hang -- which is exactly how
# a boot gets misread as stuck.
#
# Either way, failing here is enormously cheaper than failing 10 minutes into a claimed
# segment, which is what a missing or half-downloaded model actually costs.

# ---------- Fetch anything missing ----------
#
# Sources are RECORDED, never guessed. The Lightricks and Comfy-Org entries come from
# ~/LTX-2/download-ltx23.sh and download-gemma-comfy.sh on the 3090, which lived only on that
# box. The distill LoRA is Sulphur 2's, from SulphurAI/Sulphur-2-base, stored here under a
# shorter name. The checkpoint is 10Eros v1.5 from TenStrip/LTX2.3-10Eros -- verified to be
# the same 46,139,886,366-byte file the 3090 has been rendering on.
#
# THE CHECKPOINT HERE IS THE DEFAULT, and that is not a coincidence to be maintained by hand.
# It must equal engine/recipe.py's DEFAULT_CHECKPOINT, which is asserted by
# tests/test_recipe_resolve.py. A pod that fetches a checkpoint other than the default
# reports it through the heartbeat, the API's model gate hides every default pose from it,
# and it sits there claiming nothing -- indistinguishable from an empty queue.
#
# Only the default is fetched, not every checkpoint a pose might name. Each is ~46 GB, so
# fetching both 10Eros and sulphur would take a cold boot from ~58 GB to ~104 and roughly
# double time-to-first-claim. A pod simply is not offered poses it cannot render; the model
# gate (wanly-api _model_gate, console#422) already handles that correctly.
#
# WHAT a pod needs is what a RENDER loads, which is not what the workflow template names and
# not what the folder holds. The template says ltx-2.3-22b-dev.safetensors in three loaders,
# but the recipe patches all three to the render's own checkpoint before submission, so the
# dev checkpoint never loads -- 43 GB that a pod would download and never open. Same for
# ltx-2.3-22b-distilled-lora-384-1.1: the recipe substitutes the sulphur distill LoRA.
# Confirmed against the resolved graph.json of a real render rather than read off the graph
# template. That is the difference between fetching 58 GB and fetching 108.
#
# Transfer mechanism, decided by measurement rather than by what sounds fastest.
#
# Xet is the parallel path in current huggingface_hub, and HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER is
# deprecated in favour of it ("hf_transfer is not used anymore"). Enabling Xet was the obvious
# move and it was measured to be the wrong one, twice:
#
#   * it does not stream into --local-dir. Chunks go to its own cache and the file is
#     assembled at the end, so a progress meter watching the staging tree reports "0 MB so
#     far" for the entire download -- the exact silence this is meant to end. Pointing
#     HF_HOME and HF_XET_CACHE at the volume did not change that.
#   * on the 3090's link it barely moved: 42 KB in 20 seconds, against a classic download
#     that shows bytes within one 5s sample. The original note in the 3090's own script said
#     the same thing (5 MB/s Xet against 2.2 MB/s single raw curl, with the caveat that the
#     chunk cache was empty).
#
# So the classic path stays. It is single-stream, and single-stream measured 29 MB/s on a good
# pod -- fast enough that the ceiling was never the mechanism. On the one bad pod, 8 parallel
# ranges reached 3 MB/s against 0.7, which is 4x of a hopeless number: that host wanted
# killing, not tuning.
#
# HF_HOME still moves onto $MODELS. Whatever the mechanism, its cache must not land on the
# container overlay, which is 30-40 GB against a 43 GB file.
