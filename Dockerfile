# The Wanly GPU worker image — LTX 2.3.
#
# This image WAS the WAN 2.2 worker: ComfyUI plus PainterLongVideo, ReActor,
# FaceFusion and Frame-Interpolation, driven directly by the daemon's
# workflow_builder. WAN 2.2 has been retired in favour of LTX 2.3 and that whole
# stack is gone — with it, three of the nastiest traps this repo carried (the
# FaceFusion install.py clobbering the pinned onnxruntime, ReActor's unpinned
# transformers pulling a torch-incompatible release, and the CFG-aware VRAM
# patch to comfy/model_base.py).
#
# Three processes now, not two:
#
#   ComfyUI      :8188  background   the sampler
#   ltx-engine   :8190  background   graph assembly + recipe resolution
#   daemon              foreground   claims from wanly-api, drives the engine
#
# ltx-engine sits between the daemon and ComfyUI on purpose. It owns the graph:
# it uploads keyframes, resolves the recipe, patches the workflow and submits.
# The daemon does NOT build LTX graphs — every structural bug on that project
# came from rewriting a downloaded graph's topology in a caller to cover a job
# shape it was not built for, and none came from the reference workflows.
#
# The daemon is still cloned at boot rather than baked (see start.sh). The image
# is the environment; the daemon is the code.

# torch first and alone so a resolver backtrack cannot quietly pick another
# build. This is the pair proven on the 3090 for LTX 2.3.
#
# torchaudio IS pinned here, in the same line and from the same index. This comment used to
# say it was deliberately absent because no 2.12.x existed -- and predicted the consequence:
# "if a node turns out to need it, add it explicitly". A node does: ComfyUI's Lightricks
# audio VAE imports torchaudio, so pip installed it anyway, from the DEFAULT index, as a
# cu130 build. Beside a cu128 torch that fails at import with
#
#   OSError: libcudart.so.13: cannot open shared object file
#
# which killed ComfyUI on startup and restart-looped a pod for half an hour with no error
# reaching the log.
#
# It must be installed HERE, before ComfyUI's own requirements run: pip treats an already
# present 2.11.0 as satisfying "torchaudio==2.11.0" and will not replace a wrong-CUDA build
# with the right one. Verified on the pod -- the corrective install did nothing until
# --force-reinstall.
# CUDA 12.8 wheels, PINNED TO THE INDEX. Plain `pip install torch==2.12.1` resolves to
# 2.12.1+cu130, which requires an NVIDIA driver >= 580. The 3090 has 580.95 and worked; a
# RunPod 4090 had 570.195 and ComfyUI died on import with "The NVIDIA driver on your system
# is too old (found version 12080)", which failed the boot and put the pod in a restart loop.
#
# RunPod host drivers vary and cannot be chosen, so the image must run on the older one.
# cu128 runs on both.
# 2.11.0, not 2.12.1: the cu128 index tops out at 2.11.0+cu128 (2.12 ships cu130 only).
# Checked against the index rather than assumed --
# https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128/torch/ lists 2.10.0 and 2.11.0; torchvision 0.26.0
# is the matching pair. A newer torch is worth less than an image that boots on the drivers
# RunPod actually gives us.
